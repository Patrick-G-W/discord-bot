<h2>Multipurpose Discord bot for general servers</h2>
A mini project that I have decided to do in my spare time, creating a simple discord bot that can complete most actions that other bots can do. Nothing special, it will probably not bring anything original to the table.
I will eventually come up with a guide to add the bot to you're own server, but I am still building the basic commands for it at the moment.
<h4>The current list of libraries I am using:</h4>
<b> [discordpy:](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) </b> Without this I wouldn't be able to program a discord bot using Python<br>
<b> [IMDbpy:](https://imdbpy.sourceforge.io/) </b> This allows my bot to complete the .imdb commands<br>
<b> [google-images-download:](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download) </b> This allows my bot to search Google Images<br>
